This folder contains 5 different datasets for Step 3, each divided into inputs and outputs: 

Input file formatting
---------------------
The first line is: n_u N m theta_v 
The next n_u*N lines are z_{v-1}
The next n_u*N lines are zhat_{v}

Output file formatting
----------------------
All n_u*N entries of the output are z_{v}. You will compare the results from your implementation with the data in this file to make sure it's working.
